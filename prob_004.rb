# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# There's an optimization for a reduction to O(0.5*n^2)
# But that's still O(n^2) so whatevs.

# Some people get fancy with 11's, but that's not an guarenteed solution
# as odd-digited palindromic numbers aren't products of 11.

# time:  O(n^2)
# space: O(1)
# stack: O(1)
